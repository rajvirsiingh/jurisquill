          All you need to know about Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
        </h1>
        <h2>Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955<sup>1</sup></h2>
        <p>
          Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955<sup>2</sup>, specifies the
          grounds on which a spouse (husband or wife) may seek a divorce in a
          Hindu marriage. Hindu marriage is seen as a religious rite in which a
          man and a woman enter into an unbreakable and eternal partnership.
          According to the notion of Shastri Hindu law, husband and wife must
          live and die for one other, even if their relationship is painful or
          unhappy. Before 1955, there was no legal framework for obtaining
          divorce in Hindu marriages; however, with the passage of time and the
          start of the constitution, the Hindu Marriage Act came into force in
          1955<sup>2</sup>, which defined the reasons for both. Divorce is
          defined as the official end and dissolution of a marriage. Following
          divorce, both spouses are free of their marital commitments and are no
          longer considered husband and wife. Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage
          Act of 1955<sup>2</sup> is divided into subsections, clauses, and
          subclauses. There are three sections: 13, 13A, and 13B. Section 13 is
          subdivided into sections 13(1) and 13(2).
        </p>

        <h2>
          Grounds for Divorce Under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955:
        </h2>
        <p>
          This basis applies to both husband and wife, implying that both can
          seek divorce under this provision. <br />
          Section 13(1): If the marriage is solemnized before or after the start
          of this act, to get a divorce decision, they must meet the following
          conditions: <br />
          <strong>Adultery:</strong> Following Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu
          Marriage Act<sup>4</sup>, if either spouse commits adultery after the
          solemnization of marriage, the other party may move for divorce. For
          example, if H has sexual contact with another woman, S, after their
          marriage, W may bring a suit against H and seek divorce for adultery
          under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act . In the instance of
          adultery, the individual who is filing or has filed a suit must have a
          clear hand, which indicates he or she was not involved in the
          adultery. Even a single act of adultery is enough to take divorce.
          Swapna Ghose v. Sadanand Ghose<sup>5</sup>
          is a case law related to adultery.
          <br />
          <strong> Cruelty:</strong> The provision for cruelty is contained in
          section 13(1)(i)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act<sup>5</sup>. This is the
          most common cause of divorce in the current period. Cruelty is both
          physical and emotional. Physical abuse is quickly addressed, but
          mental cruelty might be harder to show. Some types of cruelty include
          dowry demands, death threats, false charges of adultery, and so on.
          <br />
          <strong>Desertion:</strong>
          is a simple concept that refers to the disengagement from marital
          duties. It is essentially the renunciation of one person, either
          husband or wife, from all marriage duties for no obvious reason
          without the permission of the other. According to Section 13(1)(i)(b)
          of the Hindu Marriage Act <sup>3</sup>, if one party has forsaken the
          other for an uninterrupted time frame of two years, one can petition
          for divorce in court. Bipin Chander Jaisinghbhai Shah vs Prabhawati
          <sup>3</sup> is one of the cases of desertion.
          <br />
          <strong>Conversion:</strong>Under Section 13(1)(ii) of the Hindu
          Marriage Act , if either spouse converts to a faith other than Hindu
          (such as Christian, Muslim, Parsi, or Jew), the offended party has the
          option of seeking divorce.
          <br />
          <strong>Insanity or mental disorder:</strong>
          If any individual, whether husband or wife, suffers from an incurable
          mental disorder of such a nature that the other person is unable to
          live with him/her, this unsoundness of mind may be grounds for divorce
          under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 <sup>4</sup>
          <br />
          <strong>Leprosy:</strong> Previously, leprosy was one of the reasons
          for divorce under Section 13 (1)(iv) of the Hindu Marriage
          Act<sup>4</sup>, but due to medical advancements and the Personal Laws
          Amendment Bill, of 2018, it is no longer a legal basis for divorce in
          the current day. It has been removed as a grounds for divorce under
          five separate personal laws.
          <br />
          <strong>Venereal Communicable illness:</strong>
          Under Section 13(1)(v) of the Hindu Marriage Act <sup>4</sup>, if one
          of the spouses has a communicable venereal illness, the other spouse
          may file for divorce. It is not essential to establish whether or not
          it was conveyed to the injured individual, regardless of the moment
          and length of his or her suffering. <br />
          <strong>Renunciation:</strong>
          According to clause 13(1)(vi) of the Hindu Marriage Act<sup>4</sup> ,
          if a spouse renounces the world (sanyasa), the other party has grounds
          for divorce. If one spouse has been renounced, it is possible to seek
          divorce under current Hindu law. The renounced individual is regarded
          as civilly dead and is free of all worldly duties. <br />
          <strong> Presumption of Death:</strong>
          By Section 13(1)(vii) of the Hindu Marriage Act<sup>6</sup> , if a
          person is not heard as alive after the solemnization of marriage for
          seven years, the other spouse may seek divorce. Even the person's
          family and relatives were unaware of this situation. <br />
          Section 13 (1-A) provides two additional reasons for both spouses to
          seek divorce. They are as follows: <br />
          No resumption of cohabitation for 1 year or more: if the husband and
          wife do not resume cohabitation of marriage for 1 year or more
          following the legal separation judgment, this might be grounds for
          divorce. <br />
          No restitution of conjugal rights: if there is no restitution of
          conjugal rights for one year or longer, the husband or wife may seek
          divorce. <br />
        </p>

        <h2>Special Grounds for Divorce Available for Wife:</h2>
        <p>
          Based on Section 13(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 <sup>7</sup> ,
          there are four more grounds for a woman to seek divorce. The woman can
          sue her spouse for divorce on the four grounds listed below: <br />
          Pre-Act of Polygamous Marriage: As per Section 13(2)(i) of the Hindu
          Marriage Act <sup>8</sup> , if the spouse has another wife before or
          after the commencement of this Act, the wife has grounds for divorce
          from her husband. Furthermore, if another wife is still living when
          the marriage is solemnized, he is unable to marry. <br />
          Rape, Sodomy, or Bestiality: under section 13 (2)(ii) of the Hindu
          Marriage Act , if the spouse after the solemnization of marriage is
          proved guilty. <br />
          Discontinuance of Cohabitation after an Order of Maintenance: As per
          Section 13 13(2)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act , if the wife has
          obtained a decree under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and
          Maintenance Act, 1956, and an order of maintenance in proceedings
          under Section 125 CrPC, 1973<sup>11</sup>, and the husband and wife
          have not resumed cohabitation after one year or more, this is a valid
          ground for divorce. <br />
          Repudiation of Marriage: Under Section 13 (2)(iv) of the Hindu
          Marriage Act<sup>11</sup>, if a marriage was solemnized before the age
          of 15 and the woman overtly or implicitly rejected the marriage before
          the age of 18, this is grounds for divorce. <br />
        </p>

        <h2>Divorce by Mutual Consent</h2>
        <p>
          According to Section 13 B of the Hindu Marriage Act<sup>11</sup>, both
          spouses with mutual consent can seek divorce; however, they must
          submit a joint petition before the district court and have not lived
          together for at least a year. Following that, they must wait 6 months
          from the date of filing the petition, and if the petition is not
          withdrawn within this time, the court may grant a divorce decision to
          both parties. The 6-month cooling period allows both parties to
          withdraw their petition if they do not wish to end their marriage.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          As a result, these are the grounds on which Hindu husbands and wives
          can seek divorce. According to Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act<sup
            >13</sup
          >
          1955 , this act applies to anyone who is a Hindu by religion in any
          form, or who is a Sikh, Jain, or Buddhist by religion, or who is
          domiciled in the territories to which this act applies but is not a
          Christian, Muslim, Parsi, or Jew by religion. As a result, everyone
          covered by Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955<sup>14</sup> is
          eligible for divorce for the reasons specified in Section 13 of the
          statute.
